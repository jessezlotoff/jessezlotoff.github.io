<h2><a id="Sudoku_How_it_Works_0"></a>Sudoku: How it Works</h2>
<p>by: <em>Jesse Zlotoff</em></p>
<p>This guide aims to provide basic information about how the Sudoku app works.  All of the code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jessezlotoff/blog_data/tree/master/sudoku">Github</a>.  It was written in/for Python 2.7.</p>
<p><strong>The part you see is in HTML</strong>, in the <code>sudoku.html</code> file.  This defines the table with a standarized name for each cell and all of the other elements on the page.  It also includes some simple in-file CSS to format the table and the buttons.  The file references a Javascript file inside the &lt;script&gt; tag.  This HTML file is hosted on my Github blog.</p>
<p><strong>The interactive parts of the app are handled by Javascript</strong>, in the <code>sudoku.js</code> file.  These functions are assigned to specific buttons in the HTML file.  Here, the standrized names of the cells are used by the code to manipulate the table programmatically.  This file is stored in the same place as the HTML file.</p>
<p>The most involved function is getSetupPuzzle().  This pulls a random puzzle and its solution as JSON from an API using an asynchronous event.  It then stores the result in global variables and populates the HTML table.</p>
<p><strong>The API is implemented in Flask</strong>, (<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">info here</a>) in the <code>my_app.py</code> file.  The code runs custom Python functions to generate the puzzle and converts it to a JSON object.  The rest of the code sets up a simple API, accepting only GET requests, to serve up the puzzles.  This code is hosted through <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a>; the API can be accessed via a browser by navigating <a href="https://jessezlotoff.pythonanywhere.com/puzzle">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The sudoku puzzles are generated by a custom Python class</strong>, in the <code>sudoku.py</code> file.  It uses a Pandas DataFrame to hold the data for a puzzle and various methods to edit and display them.  To create a new puzzle, it generates a completely filled random grid (using depth-first-search) and then randomly removes a select number of squares.  It checks that the newly created puzzle can be solved using some combination of simple and complex logic, defined by custom functions.  This file is also stored on PythonAnywhere so that the API can use it.</p>
